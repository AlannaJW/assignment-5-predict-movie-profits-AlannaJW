### Structure

This project includes three files: runner.py, data_prep.py, and logisitic_models.py.
On runner.py is where the filepath to the data is needed. Then, it calls a data preparation
function from data_prep.py, which will then call a regression function from logisitic_models.py.
In short, data_prep.py functions modify and select the data needed for the regression model 
based on which regression models are contributing to the prediction in logistic_model.py functions.
This project can predict the genre of songs from all five classes (rap, edm, pop, latin, r&b) and 
from just edm and rap.

### Implementation

#### data_prep.py


#### logisitic_models.py


### Corpus Selection and Acknowledgments

For this assignment I am working with the 30000 Spotify Songs data set that I found on Kaggle.
It is a data set of songs with 23 features and a Database Contents License (DbCL) v1.0. It was 
authored by  Charlie Thompson, Josiah Parry, Donal Phipps, and Tom Wolff from the Spotify API.
I downloaded it from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/30000-spotify-songs/data)
and will be using the single csv file with all the data. The csv file has almost 30,000 songs with 5 genres.

#### Resources

I did not copy any code segments but used these sites to inform me of various methods to 
implement my goal, usually involving numpy arrays and skylearn.
